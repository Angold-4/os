> Since its birth, Unix has been widely used by governments and civilians for over 40 years.
I believe it became a successful unique system because it was developed by a small team for their own use,
with a very simple design.
I feel the long running success of UNIX can be credited to the research in which we had total freedom to research whatever we liked.
