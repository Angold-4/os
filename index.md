## To young researchers around the world
**[2011 (27th) Japan Prize; Dr. Ritchie / Dr. Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjvjqAVkvYo)**

### **Dennis M. Ritchie**
> Since its birth, Unix has been widely used by governments and civilians for over 40 years.
I believe it became a successful unique system because it was developed by a small team for their own use,
with a very simple design.
I feel the long running success of UNIX can be credited to the research in which we had total freedom to research whatever we liked.

### **Ken L. Thompson**
> "Research" and "development" are two different things.
"Development" has clear goals but "research" is goalless, because it's the act of discovering something new.
If you are a researcher, you need to continue enjoying your research at hand.
Other than Unix,
I've had many research topics like voice recognition, language, searching, security, games, and whatever I found intersting.
Unix resulted from a research on new thing we were merely interested in,
and we are very luckey it turned out to be very fruitful.
